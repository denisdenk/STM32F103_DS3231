STM32F103C8T6 and Dallas DS3231 i2c clock
===================
Description:
-------------

This example contains a project implementation using the stm32 microcontroller and dallas ds3231 watch. The clock is connected via i2c interface, reading of time and date is realized. The STM HAL library is also used.

> Note:
 - Using STM32F103 board named "Maple Mini" and DS3231 module with EEPROM
 - Using UART_1
 - Using I2C_1
 - Internal clock 8 Mhz
